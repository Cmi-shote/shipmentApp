# ShipmentApp

ShipmentApp is a modern Android application for tracking and managing shipments, designed with a clean and intuitive user interface.

## UI Inspiration
The user interface of ShipmentApp is inspired by the beautiful design showcased on Dribbble: [Movemate Shipments Mobile App](https://dribbble.com/shots/21617837-Movemate-Shipments-Mobile-App).

## Design Approach
Where the Dribbble reference provided clear visual guidance, the app closely follows its style and layout. For features, screens, or UI elements not explicitly depicted in the Dribbble design, custom design solutions were thoughtfully created to ensure a cohesive and user-friendly experience throughout the app.
